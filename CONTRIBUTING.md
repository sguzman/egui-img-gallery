# ü§ù Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project! üéâ  
We welcome all kinds of help ‚Äî from bug fixes and features to documentation and code structure improvements. This guide outlines how to contribute effectively.

---

## üß† Philosophy

- **Small commits are powerful.** Break down your work into **atomic, granular commits** with clear messages.
- **Documentation is code.** If your change affects behavior, architecture, or flow ‚Äî **update relevant `.md` files.**
- **AI is welcome.** You may use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) to assist with coding, documentation, and brainstorming ‚Äî just review and curate the output like a pro editor.
- **Respect the format.** Keep style and formatting consistent ‚Äî use the linters and formatters provided.
- **Every file matters.** Markdown, README, and meta files like `ROADMAP.md`, `AGENT.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` should reflect the current state of the project.
